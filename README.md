# Brunch with PhoneGap and Lungo
This is a template for building fast HTML5 mobile apps. It uses [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/) for compiling/supporting different devices, [Lungo.js](http://lungo.tapquo.com/) for the mobile application framework, [Brunch.io](http://brunch.io/) for work-flow/application assembly and a little of my own optimizations, structure, and modules.

I'm pretty opinionated with my modules and views, so if you want to do it your own way just move `app/views/styles` up a directory and delete the `app/views` and `app/modules` folders along with the accompanying code in `application.coffee`.

Main languages are [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/).

Contributors welcome!
